README
======

Statusbot is a simple python IRC bot which aims to achieve rapid
dissemination of status information into a destination channel. That
information can come from several source:

1.  `/topic` changes in source channel(s)
2.  `!log` messages in source channel(s)
3.  `!status` messages in source channel(s) - this exists as an
    alternative to `!log` so users may have statusbot repeat something
    without it being logged, for channels which have a log bot
4.  In the future, statusbot may also keep a user-supplied string and
    repeat it periodically. This may or may not be useful, but you
    never know 'till you try <tt>:)</tt>

Setup
-----

To set up statusbot, you will need Python (~2.6), [python
irclib](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-irclib/), and a MySQL server. 
Set up the database with `statusbot-schema.sql` (see instructions 
below), then copy  `config.py.example` to `config.py` and set your 
authentication details.

### Setting up the MySQL database ###

`statusbot.sql` will create the database structure for you, and nothing 
else. You will need to insert your own data (either inserting to the 
database directly, or using statusbot commands). If you're doing this 
for Wikimedia Foundation projects, then `statusbot-data-wmf.sql` will 
drop and re-create the database, and insert data that hopefully makes 
sense.

Running statusbot
-----------------

To actually run the bot, try something like:

    mikelifeguard@arbour:~/statusbot$ screen -d -m -S statusbot python statusbot.py

You may have another solution for long-running background process on 
your system.

To-do
-----

There is still work to be done, and you can help. The 
[git](http://git-scm.com) repository is 
[public](http://github.com/mikelifeguard/statusbot).

1.  As mentioned above, setting an arbitrary string and repeating it is
    not yet working. The infrastructure is (mostly?) there, but it
    hasn't been tested or debugged. Perhaps it needs to be rewritten in
    a more sensible way.
2.  Mention *who* changed the topic.
3.  Figure out if we want to mention other (listen) channels in the
    main (report) channel or not & then do that. Currently we have
    half-and-half.
4.  Add support for multiple report channels.
5.  Grab updates from a site like [wikistatus](http://ezyang.com/wikistatus/)
    and report that information to IRC, or vice versa.
